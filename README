!! this likely does not abide by Suckless coding policies given
the thrown-together nature of my shell scripts. please clone and
use the original dwm repository where possible, this fork is more
for my own location to work-on / sync code (: !!

!! the dwm-brightness executable likely needs to be custom
tailored to work on your specific system. based on where the
brightness 'file' is located under your specific /sys pseudo
filesystem. you can edit these under the defines !!

!! dwm-brightness needs root, and setuid bit, which unfortunately
isn't very secure. I need to look more into alternatives here !!

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This is grufwub's fork with a few small changes, mainly as a place
for her to redownload and regularly sync changes ;p. It comes with
shortcuts added for volume and brightness modification, by calling
sh scripts / small C execs.


Requirements
------------
In order to build grufwub's dwm you need the Xlib header files, 
PulseAudio.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by modifying config.h
and (re)compiling the source code. To set your brightness / volume
modifier keys, edit the defined values in config.h using values
obtained from 'xmodmap -pk'.
